            <p>
              Each student will write a one-page QALMRI for every Student Presentation class period when they are not presenting (total of 3). There are ~6 articles for each week, and you must choose ONE of the articles to write a QALMRI on. Students who are presenting
              are not required to write a QALMRI for that week. QALMRI's are worth 15% of the course grade. They are graded on a pass/fail basis. Passes are given to students who hand in their assignment on time. QALMRIs are due before class (9:55 am)
              on the due dat. Fails are given to students who do not hand in their assignment on time. Fails may also be given to students for incomplete or obviously unsatisfactory QALMRIs.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              <strong>DUE DATES:</strong> QALMRIs are always due before class starts on presentation days.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Late QALMRIs will not be accepted</strong> and are grounds for an automatic fail for that QALMRI. The articles are posted in advance, so there is no excuse for handing in late assignments.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>Purpose of the QALMRI</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Writing weekly QALMRIs will help you comprehend the empirical papers that you read on a weekly basis. Empirical papers contain a lot of information and it requires practice to extract the central important questions that are being asked, and the main
              findings that are being reported.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              QALMRI is an acronym. It stands for the following components of empirical papers: What are the broad and specific questions?, what were the alternative hypotheses, what was the logic of the design, what was the method, what were the results, what inferences
              about the specific and broad question can be made from the results, what’s the next question?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              QALMRI is a guide to focus your reading so that you can identify these aspects of the articles you read. If you can clearly identify all of these aspects of a journal article, then you are on your way to comprehending the research you read about. The
              best way to ensure your comprehension is complete is write it out. This is why you will write a weekly QALMRI summary on the papers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>Assignment</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Each week you will write a one-page QALMRI for any one of the research papers being presented that week. The papers for each class presentation are listed on the class schedule page. You can pick from among any of these papers. If a paper presented more
              than one experiment, you may do the QALMRI for one particular experiment.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Writing a QALMRI for any research paper is simply writing short answers to each of these questions using clear and concise language. It is a condensed, short-form, version of the research. You should think of this as an efficient way to summarize the
              paper. If someone hadn’t read the paper, they should be able to get the gist of the paper from your QALMRI.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>*For a more in-depth description and explanation of how to approach a QALMRI, see the “How to use the QALMRI method” pdf posted above.</strong>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To be even more specific, your task is to answer these questions for the paper that you read:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Question:</strong> What was the broad question? What was the specific question?

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Alternative Hypotheses:</strong> What were the hypotheses?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Logic:</strong>If hypothesis #1 was true, what was the predicted outcome? What was the predicted outcome if hypothesis #2 was true?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Methods:</strong> What was the experimental design and the methods used in the experiment(s)?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Results:</strong>What was the pattern of data? What was the main finding?

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Inferences:</strong>What can be concluded about the hypotheses based on the data? What can be concluded about the specific and broad question?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              How long is a QALMRI? Long enough to answer each question with clear and brief sentences. Should be about one-page (single-spaced).

            Each student will be responsible for giving one 10 minute in-class presentation during the semester. The presentation will be a summary of one of the journal articles assigned for each presentation slot.
The presentation sign ups will be given out the first day of class and finalized by Feb. 4.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are 4 presentation days. Each day will consist of 4-5 student presentations, each on different empirical articles from the cognitive literature.
          </p>
